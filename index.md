This is an introduction to High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Research Computing in general for users of our clusters.
You will learn the basic command line interface, editors, job submission and a few other topics that allow you to make efficient use of a High Performance Computing cluster.

This lesson pretends to go straight to the point. You will learn the most useful tools, commands and techniques to start using the cluster for your research. As such, no completeness should be assumed. For each episode there is a lot more to explore on the interest of more advanced users. Some references are left at the end of each section.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson assume no previous knowledge of Linux and the command line interface (CLI). If you are only familiar with GUI applications on any OS (Windows, MacOS or Linux) expect a bit of rough start but please do not loose you motivation. Learning Linux and command lines is like exploring a new language, expect mistakes and frustrations, but also rewards as you move forward and start grasping the tools that will make your interaction with the cluster more efficient and your research more dynamic.
