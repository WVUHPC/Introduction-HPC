During your interaction with the cluster from the command line you need to deal with text files.
As we learn from the previous episode, for just reading files, we can use the commands `cat`, `more` and `less`.
For modifying text files we need a different application, a text editor. Notice that on the cluster we are working with pure text files in contrast with office applications like Microsoft Word and equivalent free versions like LibreOffice. Those applications are called "Word Processors" as they not only deal with the text content but they also are in charge of the control how the text is presented on screen and on paper. "Word Processors" are not the same as "Text Editors" and for most cases "Word Processors" are of no use in HPC clusters.

Text editors work just with the characters, spaces and new lines. When a file only contain those elements without any information about formatting, the file is said is in "Plain Text". There is one important difference on how Windows and Linux/Linux marks new lines, making Windows "Text Files" as having some extra "spurious" characters at the end of each line and text files created on Linux as having no new lines at all when read with Windows applications like "Notepad".
To solve this situation, there are a couple of applications on Linux that convert from one "flavor" of text file into the other. They are "dos2unix" and "unix2dos".

There are several terminal-based text editors available on Linux/Unix.  
From those we have selected three to present on this episode for you.
They are  **nano**, **emacs**, and **vim**.
Your choice of an editor depends mostly on how much functionality do you want from your editor,
how many fingers do you want to use for a given command, and the learning curve to master it.
There is nothing wrong of using one of those editors over the others. Beginners of user who rarely edit files would find **nano** a pretty fine and simple editor for their needs that has basically no learning curve. If you advance deeper into the use of the cluster and edit files often your choice will be most likely one between **emacs** or **vi/vim** with the choice being mostly a matter of preference as both are full featured editors.

**nano** and **emacs** are *direct input editors*, ie you start writing directly as soon as you type with the keyboard. In contrast **vi/vim** is a *modal* editor. You type keys to change modes on the editor, some of these keys allowing you to start typing or return to *command mode* where new commands can be entered.
In any case there are quite a large number of commands and key combinations that can be entered on any of those editors. For this episode we will concentrate our attention on a very specific set of skills that once learned will give you to work with text files. The skills are:

   * Open the editor to open a file, save the file that is being edited or saving the file and leaving the editor.
   * Move around the file being edited. Going to the beginning, the end or a specific line.
   * Copy, cut and paste text on the same file.
   * Search for a set of characters and use the search and replace functionality.

There is far more to learn in a text editor, each of those skills can be go deeper into more complex functionality and that is the major difference between **nano** and the other two editor, the later giving you far more complexity and power in the skills at the price of a steeper learning curve.

## Meta, Alt and Option keys

On modern keyboards the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key has come to replace the <kbd>Meta</kbd> key of the old MIT keyboards. Both **nano** and **emacs** make extensive use of <kbd>Meta</kbd> for some key combinations. A situation that can be confusing on windows machines with <kbd>Alt</kbd> and <kbd>Win</kbd> keys and on Mac with the <kbd>Option</kbd> and <kbd>Command</kbd> keys.

Since the 1990s <kbd>Alt</kbd> has been printed on the <kbd>Option</kbd> key (‚å• Opt) on most Mac keyboards. Alt is used in non-Mac software, such as non-macOS Unix and Windows programs, but in macOS it is always referred as the Option key. The <kbd>Option</kbd> key's behavior in macOS differs slightly from that of the Windows <kbd>Alt</kbd> key (it is used as a modifier rather than to access pull-down menus, for example).

On Macs Terminal application under the "Edit" > "Use Option as Meta key".
For **emacs** you can use <kbd>ESC</kbd> as a replacement of the <kbd>Meta</kbd> key.

### Nano

Nano is a small andfriendly editor with commands that are generally accessed by using Control (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>) combined with some other key.

#### Opening and closing the editor

You can start editing a file using a command line like this:

~~~
$ nano myfile.f90
~~~
{: .language-bash}

To leave the editor type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, you will be asked if you want to save your file to disk.  
Another option is to save the file with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> but remaing on the editor.

#### Moving around the file

On **nano** you can start typing as soon you open the file and the arrow keys will move you back and for on the same line or up and down on lines.
For large files is always good to learn how to move to the begining and end of the file. Use <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>\</kbd> and <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> to do that. Those key combinations are also shown as `M-\` (first line) `M-/` (last line).
To move to a specific line and column number use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>_</kbd>, shown on the bottom bar as `^_`

#### Copy, cut and paste

The use the internal capabilities of the text editor to copy and paste starts by selecting the area of text that you want to copy or cut. Use <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to start selecting the area to copy use <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>6</kbd> to delete use  <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>Delete</kbd>, to cut but save the contents  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> to paste the contents of the region <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd>     

#### Search for text and search and Replace

To search use  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>, you can repeat the command to searching for more matches, to search and replace use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>\</kbd> enter the text to search and the text to replace in place.  

#### Reference

Beyond the quick commands above, there are several commands available on **nano**, and the list below comes from the help text that you can see when execute <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd>.
When you see the symbol \"\^\", it means to press the Control <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key; the symbol \"M-\" is called Meta, but in most keyboards is identified with the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key or <kbd>Windows</kbd> key. See above for the discussion about the use of <kbd>Meta</kbd> key.

### Emacs

Emacs is an extensible, customizable, open-source text editor. Together
with **vi/vim** is one the most widely used editors in Linux/Unix environments.
There are a big number of commands, customization and extra modules
that can be integrated with Emacs. We will just briefly cover the
basics as we did for **nano**

#### Opening and closing the editor

In addition to the terminal-base editor, **emacs** also has a GUI environment that could be selected by default. To ensure that you remain in terminal-based version use:

~~~
$ emacs -nw data.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

To leave the editor execute <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd>, if you want to save the file to disk use
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd>, another representation of the keys to save and close could be `C-x C-s C-x C-c`, actually, the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key can be keep pressed while you hit the sequence `x s x c` to get the same effect.

#### Moving around the file

To go to the beginning of the file use <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd><</kbd> to the end of the file <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>></kbd>. To go to a given line number use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>g</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>g</kbd>

#### Copy, cut and paste

To copy or cut regions of text starts by selecting the area of text that you want to copy or cut. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> to start selecting the area. To copy use <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd> to delete use  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>, to cut but save the contents <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>. Finally, to paste the contents of the region <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd>     

#### Search for text and search and Replace

To search use  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>, you can repeat the command to searching for more matchs, to search and replace use <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>%</kbd> enter the text to search and the text to replace in place.  

### Reference

The number of commands for Emacs is large, here the basic list of
commands for editing, moving and searching text.

The best way of learning is keeping at hand a sheet of paper with the commands
For example [GNU Emacs Reference Card](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf) can show you most commands that you need.

Below you can see the same 2 page Reference Card as individual images.

### Vi/Vim

The third editor is **vi** and found by default installed on Linux/Unix systems.
The *Single UNIX Specification* and *POSIX* describe **vi**, so every conforming system must have it.
A popular implementation of **vi** is **vim** that stands as an improved version. On our clusters we have **vim** installed.

#### Opening and closing the editor

You can open a file on **vim** with

~~~
$ vim code.py
~~~
{: .language-bash }

vi is a modal editor: it operates in either *insert mode* (where typed
text becomes part of the document) or *normal mode* (where keystrokes are
interpreted as commands that control the edit session). For example,
typing i while in normal mode switches the editor to insert mode, but
typing i again at this point places an \"i\" character in the document.
From insert mode, pressing <kbd>ESC</kbd> switches the editor back to normal mode. On the lines below we ask for pressing the <kbd>ESC</kbd> in case you are in *insert mode* to ensure you get back to *normal mode*

To leave the editor without saving type <kbd>ESC</kbd> follow by `:q!`.
To leave the editor saving the file type <kbd>ESC</kbd> follow by `:x`
To just save the file and continue editing type <kbd>ESC</kbd> follow by `:w`.

#### Moving around the file

On vim you can use the arrow keys to move around. In the traditional **vi** you have to use the following keys (on normal mode):

* <kbd>H</kbd> Left
* <kbd>J</kbd> Down
* <kbd>K</kbd> Up
* <kbd>L</kbd> Right

Go to the first line using <kbd>ESC</kbd> follow by `:1`.
Go to the last line using <kbd>ESC</kbd> follow by `:$`.

#### Copy, cut and paste

To copy areas of text you start by entering in visual mode with <kbd>v</kbd>,
selecting the area of interest and using <kbd>d</kbd> to delete, <kbd>y</kbd> to copy and <kbd>p</kbd> to paste.

#### Search for text and search and Replace

To search use  <kbd>/</kbd> and the text you want to search, you can repeat the command to searching for more matches with <kbd>n</kbd>, to search and replace use `:%s/<search pattern>/<replace text>/g` enter the text to search and the text to replace everywhere. Use `:%s/<search pattern>/<replace text>/gc` to ask for confirmation before each modification.

> ## Exercise 1
>
> Select an editor. The challenge is write this code in a file called `Sierpinski.c`
>
> ~~~
> #include <stdio.h>
>
> #define SIZE (1 << 5)
> int main()
> {
>     int x, y, i;
>     for (y = SIZE - 1; y >= 0; y--, putchar('\n')) {
>         for (i = 0; i < y; i++) putchar(' ');
>         for (x = 0; x + y < SIZE; x++)
>             printf((x & y) ? "  " : "* ");
>     }
>     return 0;
> }
>
> ~~~
> {: .source}
>
> For those using **vi**, here is the challenge. **You cannot use the arrow keys**. Not a single time!
> It is pretty hard if you are not used to it, but it is a good exercise to learn the commands.
>
> Another interesting challenge is to write the line `for (y = SIZE - 1; y >= 0; y--, putchar('\n'))` and copy and paste it to > form the other 2 *for loops* in the code, and editing only after being copied.
>
> Once you have successfully written the source code, you can see your hard work in action.
>
> On the terminal screen, execute this:
>
> ~~~
> $ gcc Sierpinski.c -o Sierpinski
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> This will compile your source code `Sierpinski.c` in C into a binary executable called `Sierpinski`. Execute the code with:
>
> ~~~
> $ ./Sierpinski
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> The resulting output is kind of a surprise so I will not post it here.
> The original code comes from [rosettacode.org](http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle#C)
>

> ## Exercise 2 (Needs X11)
>
> On the folder `workshops_hands-on/Introduction_HPC/4._Terminal-based_Editors` you will find a Java code on file `JuliaSet.java`.
>
> For this exercise you need to connect to the cluster with X11 support.
> On Spruce that will be:
>
> ~~~
> $ ssh -X <username>@spruce.hpc.wvu.edu
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> Once you are there execute this command to load the Java compiler
>

> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> Once you have loaded the module go to the folder `workshops_hands-on/Introduction_HPC/4._Terminal-based_Editors` and compile > the Java code with this command
>
> ~~~
> $ javac JuliaSet.java
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> and execute the code with:
>
> ~~~
> $ java JuliaSet
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> A window should pop up on your screen.
> Now, use one of the editors presented on this episode and do the changes mentioned on the source code to made the code > multithreaded.
> Repeat the same steps for compiling and executing the code.
>
> Change a bit the parameters on the code, the size of the window for example or the constants CX and CY.
>
{: .challenge}

> Exercise 3
>
> Download the data about Covid 19
>
> ~~~
> $> sh download-covid19.sh
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> Open the file ``owid-covid-data.csv`` with your favorite editor and search for the line with ``United States,2021-06-30``
>
> Go to to the first and last line on that file. The file is extense so do not try to scroll line by line.

> ## Why vi was programmed to not use the arrow keys?
>
>From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) with a anecdotal story from [The register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/09/11/bill_joys_greatest_gift/)
>
> Joy used a Lear Siegler ADM-3A terminal. On this terminal, the Escape key was at the location now occupied by the Tab key on the widely used IBM PC keyboard (on the left side of the alphabetic part of the keyboard, one row above the middle row). This made it a convenient choice for switching vi modes. Also, the keys h,j,k,l served double duty as cursor movement keys and were inscribed with arrows, which is why vi uses them in that way. The ADM-3A had no other cursor keys. Joy explained that the terse, single character commands and the ability to type ahead of the display were a result of the slow 300 baud modem he used when developing the software and that he wanted to be productive when the screen was painting slower than he could think.
